                            <li>The CDC has been facilitating the implementation of group-based Diabetes Prevention Programs (DPP), using leaders who have been through DPP life coach training.</li>
                            <li>Designed for people at high risk of developing diabetes like those with prediabetes or women who have a past history of gestational diabetes, the DPP meets approximately 16 times over the first 6 months and then once a month for the next 6 months.</li>
                            <li>Online programs like Zoom are available and convenient options for people who find it difficult to attend in person programs or do not have access to diabetes prevention programs in their regions.</li>
                            <li>The program is also offered in several areas across the U.P. Dial 2-1-1 or log onto www.diabetesinmichigan.org to find where diabetes prevention programs are offered in the Upper Peninsula.</li>

                            <li>External Triggers: For many people, seeing food, smelling it or remembering that a particular food is in the house can trigger them to eat. A little or a lot of extra food here and there can lead to weight gain – 100 extra calories a day may yield 10 pounds of weight gain in a year.</li>
                            <li>Fun Time Triggers: Being out with other people –eating out, socializing or at a party is usually associated with taking in more calories. People will often eat more and/or drink more when they are with other people.</li>
                            <li>Emotional Triggers: Some of us deal with negative emotions through eating, especially while alone. Finding other ways to more effectively prevent or address negative emotions, like going for a walk or phoning a friend is important.</li>
                            <li>Despite these triggers, sometimes you really are hungry and just need to eat!</li>

                            <li>Feelings of stress release the hormone cortisol which helps raise the blood sugar and facilitates other changes in the body to prepare you for ‘fight or flight.’</li>
                            <li>If you constantly feel under stress, cortisol can work to push you toward developing type 2 diabetes.</li>
                            <li>The other way that stress impacts type 2 diabetes development is through the unhealthy behaviors that often occur when a person feels ‘stressed out’.</li>
                            <li>Some of the ways to reduce or manage stress that are addressed in the DPP include:</li>

                                <li>Asking for help from others</li>
