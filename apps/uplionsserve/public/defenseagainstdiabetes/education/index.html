                            <li>Diabetes is a chronic (long-lasting) health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy.</li>
                            <li>Food is broken down into sugar and released into the bloodstream.</li>
                            <li>When blood sugar goes up, it signals the pancreas to release insulin.</li>
                            <li>Insulin acts like a key to let the blood sugar into your body’s cells for use as energy.</li>

                            <li>If you have diabetes, your body either doesn’t make enough insulin or can’t use the insulin it makes as well as it should.</li>
                            <li>When there isn’t enough insulin, too much blood sugar stays in your bloodstream. </li>
                            <li>Over time, that can cause serious health problems, such as heart disease, vision loss, and kidney disease.</li>
                            <li>There isn’t a cure yet for type 2 diabetes, but losing weight, eating healthy food, being active and taking medication if needed, can be really helpful. </li>
                            <li>Type 1 diabetes has no cure, and can’t be prevented. Insulin must be used everyday.</li>

                            <li>Your doctor will have you take one or more of the following blood tests to confirm the diagnosis:</li>
                            <li><span class="bold1">A1C Test</span>: measures your average blood sugar level over the past 2 or 3 months.</li>
                            <li><span class="bold1">Fasting Blood Sugar Test</span>: measures your blood sugar after an overnight fast (not eating).</li>
                            <li><span class="bold1">Glucose Tolerance Test</span>: measures your blood sugar before and after you drink a liquid that contains glucose. You’ll fast (not eat) overnight before the test and have your blood drawn to determine your fasting blood sugar level. Then you’ll drink the liquid and have your blood sugar level checked 1 hour, 2 hours, and possibly 3 hours afterward.</li>
                            <li><span class="bold1">Random Blood Sugar Test</span>: measures your blood sugar at the time you’re tested. You can take this test at any time and don’t need to fast (not eat) first.</li>

                                <li>If your doctor thinks you have type 1 diabetes, your blood may also tested for autoantibodies that are often present in type 1 diabetes.</li>
